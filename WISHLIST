FEATURES
********

  o zoo()
    - support zoo data.frame objects
    - fully support zoo factor objects [limited support already 
      available]
 
    
  o merge()
    - merge.zoo to accept non-zoo arguments (other than first)
      if all zoo args have same index and all args have same
      NROW value.  In that case the non-zoo args are to be given
      the common index by default.

    - allow a scalar non-zoo element as an argument to merge.zoo in
      which case it cbinds a constant zoo column to the same merge
      that would have been created without the scalar. [GG: Not sure we
      really need this but I put it down so I would not forget.]

    - names not processed correctly when retclass = "list"


  o formulas
    - allow for a simplified model language like
        d(y) ~ l(y, 1)
      instead of
        diff(y) ~ lag(y, k = -1)
      [maybe: define these in the zoo, but do not export?]

        
  o [.zoo [<-.zoo
    - allow indexing by index, i.e., datetime argument


  o misc functions
    - rapply: a function for applying functions to rolling windows
      [prototype ready but not yet in release version]

    - interface to additional statistical routines such as the ones
      referenced in:
      http://CRAN.R-project.org/doc/contrib/Ricci-refcard-ts.pdf

    - irregular to regular conversion routines [prototypes for     
      functions functions like as.ts.zoo(), is.regular() are ready
      but not yet in release version]


  o QA
    - regression test suite

    - additional use and testing



INTERFACES
**********

  o move as.its.zoo over to its [Z: Whit will do this as the new
    maintainer of its]

  o provide fBasics interface routine to the Rmetrics projects

  o some data to include with zoo

  o more examples for the help files

  o FAQ
  
  o what facilities does the R project provide to subprojects for 
    mailing lists, web space, wiki, forum, etc.
