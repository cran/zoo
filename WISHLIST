FEATURES
********

  o examples: example(aggregate.zoo) could have an example
    where there's intra-day data which is reduced to a grid
    of (say) five-minute returns.

  o design: re-think shared design of parameter and panel
    functions for plotting.

  o bugs: rollmax, rollmedian give Error for k=1.

  o zoo methods for dbReadTable and dbWriteTable to facilitate
    using zoo objects with DBI

  o zoo(NULL, ...), zooreg(NULL, ...)

  o register S3 methods and use namespaces so that this works:
     f <- local(function(x) zoo::index(x), baseenv())

  o make "zoo" enforce the index entries to be unique (which is 
    assumed in a few functions such as merge.zoo).

  o provide a [<-.zoo method that is fully consistent with [.zoo
    so that the following works:
      a <- zoo(matrix(1:10,5,2), 2001:2005)
      a[I(2003), 2] <- NA
    (Note: as in window<-.zoo)

  o rollmean returns all NAs when na.pad = TRUE

  o allow plot.zoo to accept a list of zoo objects -- this would
    be particularly useful in the case of line plots of multiple series
    with different time bases since NAs are introduced by merging 
    and they can cause the drawn lines to be undesirably broken.
    (Current workaround is to use na.approx.)

  o more graphical facilities, e.g., a pairs function, make
    plot.zoo(x, y) work with multivariate series (plotting every
    combination of plot(x[,i], y[,j]))

  o incorporate runmean in package caMassClass
 
  o allow log to be specified per plot in plot.zoo
  
  o performance enhancement when using arithmetic on zoo objects. Check
    if they have same index first.

  o speedup for indexing strictly regular series. Test with is.regular first.
	set.seed(1)

	x <- ts(rnorm(5000))
	xz <- as.zoo(x)
	system.time({  ################################
	  for(i in 1:5000) if (is.regular(x)) 
		x[(i - tsp(x)[1])*frequency(x) + 1] <- 0
	else
		window(xz, start = i, end = i) <- 0
	},
	gc = TRUE)
	system.time( for (i in 1:5000) xz[I(i)] <- 0, gc = TRUE )
	system.time( for (i in 1:5000) window(xz, start=i, end=i) <- 0, 
		gc = TRUE 

  o zoo()
    - support zoo data.frame objects (and zoo list objects)
    - fully support zoo factor objects [limited support already 
      available]
    - idea: new class "Zoo" that is not a matrix plus attribute
            but a list with slots "coredata", "index" and "frequency". 
    
  o merge()
    - names not processed correctly when retclass = "list"

        
  o misc functions
    - interface to additional statistical routines such as the ones
      referenced in:
      http://CRAN.R-project.org/doc/contrib/Ricci-refcard-ts.pdf
      [Z: with as.ts.zoo() most of the functions work directly
       by coercing the first argument to "ts"]


  o QA
    - regression test suite
    - additional use and testing

  o xyplot.zoo.  Currently default lattice colors for lines are used 
    as defaults for both lines and points.  Fix it so lattice default
    colors for points are used as defaults for points.

  o make.par.list.  names, other than correspondence names, are
    not allowed on x.  Perhaps this should be allowed if m = 1
    or perhaps it should be allowed if x is not a list and
    correspondence names only allowed for lists.

  o rollapply.default

  o as of lattice 0.12-14 lattice:::updateList could be replaced with
    modifyList
